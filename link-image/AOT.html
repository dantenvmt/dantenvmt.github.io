<p><h2>Just normal introduction:</h2> <strong>Attack on Titan</strong> (Japanese: 進撃の巨人 Hepburn: Shingeki no Kyojin, lit. "Advancing Giant") is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Hajime Isayama. The series began in Kodansha's Bessatsu Shōnen Magazine on September 9, 2009, and has been collected into 23 tankōbon volumes as of August 2017. It is set in a world where humanity lives in cities surrounded by enormous walls; a defense against the Titans, gigantic humanoids that eat humans seemingly without reason. The story initially centers on <strong>Eren Yeager</strong> and his childhood friends <strong>Mikasa Ackerman</strong> and <strong>Armin Arlert</strong>, who join the military to fight the Titans after their home town is invaded and Eren's mother is eaten. However, as the story progresses and the truths about the Titans are slowly revealed to the reader, the narrative shifts to encompass <strong>Historia Reiss</strong>, squad leader <strong>Levi</strong>, Eren's father Grisha, and other supporting characters.</p>
<h3> As Usual, Plot: (also included season 2)</h3>
<p>The story of Attack on Titan revolves around the adventures of Eren Yeager, his foster sister, Mikasa Ackerman, and their childhood friend Armin Arlert. After the wall which protects their hometown of Shinganshina is breached by the Colossal Titan leading the other Titans to enter, Eren watches in horror as a smiling Titan eats his mother. Vowing to kill all the Titans, Eren enlists in the military, along with his friends.<br>

<p>Five years later, the three cadet graduates are positioned in Trost District, one of the border towns jutting out of Wall Rose when the Titans attack again. In the ensuing battle, Eren saves Armin from being eaten by a bearded Titan, at the cost of him being eaten himself. A Titan later appears and begins fighting the other Titans while ignoring humans; the Titan is revealed to be Eren, who has developed the ability to transform into one. Though he is seen as a threat by some, he helps the military take back Trost District. After being placed on trial for being a danger to the humans, he is taken in by the Survey Corps' Special Operations Squad, led by Captain <strong>Levi</strong>.<br>

<P style="font-size: 10px";> OMFGGGGGGGGGGGG, it's Levi ............... *fan girl screaming*

<p>In an expedition to Shinganshina, the Scouts are attacked by a Female Titan who attempts to capture Eren. Although the Scouts are able to briefly capture the Female Titan, she breaks free and devastates Levi's squad, forcing the expedition to retreat. Armin determines that the Female Titan is Annie, one of the cadets who taught Eren to fight, and devises a plan to capture her at Stohess. During this operation, collateral damage reveals that Titans reside in and make up the walls surrounding the human settlements.<br>

<p>Some of Eren's friends are also revealed to be able to transform into Titans and had been sent as spies by an unknown party to find something called "The Coordinate". It is later confirmed that the Coordinate is the power to control other Titans at will, and that Eren holds that power. The royal family and the Military Police track Eren and his friend Krista Lenz, who is actually Historia Reiss, the successor to the real king, Rod Reiss, with the current king being but a figurehead.<br>

<p>The Survey Corps, losing all will to follow the current government, stage a successful rebellion to overthrow the monarchy, culminating with the death of Rod by the hands of his own daughter, who becomes the new queen. It is then revealed that the Reiss Family was responsible for the creation of the walls 100 years ago using the Coordinate, which was stolen by Eren's father Grisha, who then transferred it to Eren's body by turning him into a Titan before allowing his son to devour him.<br>

<p>By making use of a new power obtained by Eren that allows him to create massive and permanent structures, the Survey Corps hold another expedition, this time managing to reach Shiganshina and seal the breach to reclaim Wall Maria. However, they are ambushed by Zeke, the man behind the Titan invasions and the spies, leading an army of Titans including the Colossal Titan against them. The battle ends with Zeke retreating, and the Colossal Titan defeated and killed by Armin, who became a Titan Shifter like Eren, but at the cost of the lives of almost all the members of the expedition, including the commander of the Survey Corps, Erwin Smith.<br>

<p>Before returning home, the survivors explore the basement of Eren and Mikasa's old house and recover evidence proving that the human civilization beyond the walls is not extinct as they were always led to believe, but is in fact, thriving. However, they also discover that their race, the Eldians, are being oppressed and persecuted by the Marleyans, the ruling race that with the objective of conquering their island, Paradis, and seizing their natural resources, have transformed Eldian prisoners into rogue Titans to keep them trapped inside the walls and sent Zeke, Annie, and the other Titan Shifters to steal the Coordinate. In the occasion, Eren also learns that Zeke is his older half-brother, who betrayed their father and defected to the Marleyans. After Wall Maria is reclaimed, Eren and the others make preparations for their imminent confrontation with the Marleyan forces. <br>

<P>The story then shifts to four years later, where Marley forces including Titan Shifters like Zeke and Reiner, as well as warriors in training to inherit their powers are fighting against another nation called the Mid-East Allied Forces. Though Marley wins the war, they are devastated by the new invention of Anti-Titan artillery which can seriously harm and even kill the most well fortified Titan Shifters. Thus Zeke tells Marley military command that they must once again attempt to steal Eren's Coordinate power or Marley's position as a world hegemony will cease.<br>
