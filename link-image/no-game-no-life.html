    <p> Let aside all the facts of this anime&#44; it's time for the review&#46; <strong> No Game No Life </strong> is definitely the best anime of 2013&#46; The series follows Sora and his younger stepsister Shiro&#44; two hikikomori who make up the identity of Blank&#44; an undefeated group of gamers&#46; One day&#44; they are challenged by the god of games to chess and are victorious&#46; As a result&#44; the god summons them to Disboard&#44; a reality which revolves around games&#46; Intent on maintaining their reputation as the undefeated gamers&#44; Sora and Shiro plan to conquer the sixteen ruling species and to usurp the god of games&#46; </p>
    <p> the hightlight of the anime is the moment when they have a fight with the 6th exceed <strong>&#40;Flügel&#41;</strong>&#46; Speaking about magic, <strong>Flügel</strong> is called the god killer&#46; I guess it's enough for you to imagine their strength&#46; However&#44; when <strong>Tet</strong> became the <strong>One True God</strong> and <strong><em>The Ten Pledges</em></strong> was given&#44; they cannot use their power to takeover lands and resources&#46; Therefore&#44; they try to collect every pieces of information they can get&#46; In order to kill Jibril &#40;a Flugel&#41;&#44; <strong>Kuuhaku</strong> has to set her into a trap by using their knowledge about the real world &#40;Their World&#41; </p>
