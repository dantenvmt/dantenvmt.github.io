	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p><strong>Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works</strong> (officially Fate/stay night [Unlimited Blade Works]) is a 2014–2015 action, thriller, fantasy anime based on the visual novel Fate/stay night produced by <strong>Type-Moon</strong>. The plot of the episodes is primarily based on the Unlimited Blade Works storyline in the Fate/stay night visual novel, in which <strong>Shirō Emiya</strong>, a high school student and amateur magus living in Fuyuki City, Japan, is dragged into the Fifth Holy Grail War, a secret magical tournament. In it, seven participants, known as Masters, and their Servants, reincarnated personifications of legendary heroes of history, fight in a battle royale for the <strong>Holy Grail</strong>, an omnipotent magical chalice that can fulfill any wish or desire for its victor. Shirō and his Servant, <strong>Saber</strong>, are forced to team up with Rin Tōsaka, another Master in the Holy Grail War, but Shirō finds himself earning the strong dislike of Rin's mysterious Servant, Archer, whose motivations are unknown.
	<h3>Plot:</h3>
	<p>Shortly after repelling Lancer, Saber prepares to attack Archer who approaches. However, Shirou uses his Command Spell to negate that action and ends up conversing with Rin. In the end, no alliance is made at the time. After introducing Shirou to the Holy Grail War rules from Kirei, Illyasviel von Einzbern attacks them with her Servant Berserker on their way home. Unlike in the Fate route, Archer briefly participates in the battle and his help proves to be vital in driving Berserker away. The next day, Shirou goes to school with Saber, introducing her to Taiga and Sakura.<br>

<p>The next day, when all other students and teachers leave the school, Rin starts her assault on Shirou, relentlessly pursuing him with the intent to kill him unless he surrenders Saber's Command Spells. She is interrupted at the last moment by the sudden appearance of Rider, who attacks a student. Shirou and Rin promptly team up to drive Rider away. Shirou catches a quick glimpse of Shinji as they do.<br>

<p>Shirou and Rin form a truce and begin searching for possible candidates for Rider's Master. That night, Shirou is urged to go to the Ryuudou Temple through the magic of Caster, who also wishes to take away his Command Spell. Archer interrupts and saves Shirou while Saber confronts Assassin. It is at this moment that Shirou starts to get even more irritated by Archer, who has looked down on his ideals. Archer then attacks Shirou, but is stopped by Saber and Assassin.<br>

<p>After that, Rin begins to have dreams about a hero who was betrayed by his ideals. Rin apologizes to Shirou for Archer's actions and tells him that she used a Command Spell to order Archer to never attack Shirou. During strategy planning, Rider activates Blood Fort Andromeda. However, when Shirou and Rin approach her, they find her already dead. The terrified Shinji runs off to the Kotomine Church, where Kirei grants him the use of Gilgamesh. In the meantime, Archer and Saber debate over how Rider was killed; while Saber claims she died in honor protecting her Master, Archer claims she was a weakling, once again creating a rift between him and the rest.<br>

<p>Rider's death makes Shirou suspect that there is another Master in the school, one other than Shinji. He suspects his friend Issei Ryuudou at first, but it turns out that the Master is their teacher Soichiro Kuzuki, who controls Caster. When Shirou and Rin ambush them, Kuzuki surprises them with his innate fighting abilities, enhanced by Caster's enchantment spells, which are able to cripple Saber. In order to make it easier to plan and strategize, Rin comes to stay at Shiro's house.<br>

<p>The next day, Rin takes Shirou on a date, bringing Saber along. On returning home, they find Caster holding Taiga Fujimura hostage. When Shirou tries to follow her demands, Caster releases Taiga and strikes Saber with the Rule Breaker, transferring Shirou's Command Spells to her. At Saber's urging, Shirou and Rin leave. With his Command Spells gone, Rin declares that she will fight Kuzuki and Caster with only Archer. However, Shirou insists on helping and follows them despite Rin's objections. Meanwhile, Caster tortures Saber in an effort to break her and make her submit completely. However, Saber's magic resistance proves to be an obstacle for Caster's Command Spell.<br>

<p>Shirou follows Rin and witnesses her confronting Kuzuki and Caster in the Kotomine Church, their new base of operation. To her shock, Archer suddenly betrays Rin and attacks her. Shirou saves her and confessed his feelings for her, and although she is reluctant and embarrassed, she eventually thanks him and accepts his help again. With Archer gone, both decide to ask Ilya and Berserker for their help. Unfortunately, they arrive too late and find Shinji and Gilgamesh have gotten there first. Gilgamesh makes short work of Berserker, then rips Ilya's heart out. Both of them then leave the castle, leaving Shirou and Rin in despair until Lancer suddenly emerges and offers his help, which they accept.<br>

<p>They return to the Kotomine Church, where Lancer fights Archer again. Archer admits defeat and retreats into the church. Meanwhile, Shirou and Rin team up to fight Kuzuki and Caster, ending in a stalemate. Caster tries to turn the tables and use a spell to completely dominate Saber and send her against Shirou and Rin. But before she can, Archer arrives and attacks Kuzuki. Caster dies protecting Kuzuki, who Archer then kills. He reveals that he was only faking his loyalty to Caster in order to eliminate her, as well as use her Rule Breaker to remove his contract with Rin and allow him to do what he has planned since the beginning - kill Shirou. In the wake of this, Rin makes a new contract with Saber, thereby making her Saber's master. Archer then kidnaps Rin and takes her hostage to the Einzbern Castle, where Shinji attempts to sexually abuse her.<br>

<p>The next day, Shirou, Saber and Lancer head to the Einzbern Castle, whereupon Archer reveals that he is an alternate future Emiya Shirou, the hero who is betrayed by the ideals he fought for, and now he seeks to create a time paradox by killing his past self. He considers this an act of mercy, not wanting Shirou to see his ideals betray and crush him like the way they crushed Archer. While Shirou fights, Lancer goes to rescue Rin. Kirei suddenly appears and orders Lancer to kill her. However, Lancer demands that Kirei use his Command Spell for such an order, and Kirei does, ordering Lancer to kill himself instead. Rin is about to submit to her fate as Kirei approaches to kill her, when suddenly Lancer stabs Kirei in the back using Gae Bolg. Shinji, now believing he is free to do whatever he likes to Rin, is chased off by a just-revived Lancer. After setting Rin free, Lancer activates his Ansuz rune, burning the room as he dies.<br>

<p>Shirou faces off with Archer, finally convincing Archer that he is not taking the wrong path as he has no regrets about his decision, no matter what repercussions it may have in the future. With that, Archer is defeated. Gilgamesh then appears, attempting to kill Shirou because of his nature as a "Faker", but Archer pushes Shirou out of the path of Gilgamesh's attack, seemingly sacrificing himself  He then retreats when the fire started by Lancer inflames the whole castle and destroys it. Gilgamesh catches up with Shinji and inserts Ilya's heart into his body, making him the new incarnation of the Holy Grail.<br>

<p>That night, Rin makes a contract with Shirou to give him mana so that he could battle Gilgamesh. Shirou, Rin and Saber reach Gilgamesh's new hideout, the Ryuudou Temple. Rin tries to pull Shinji out of the embodiment of the Grail while Shirou fights Gilgamesh and Saber is held back by Assassin. Shirou is able to take out Gilgamesh by using his own version of Unlimited Blade Works. However, Gilgamesh revives one last time to try and make him the new incarnation of the Holy Grail. Fortunately, Archer, who also appeared to help Rin at the same time, comes to Shirou's aid, finishing off Gilgamesh with an arrow to the head. Rin bids her Servant goodbye, as Archer tells her to take care of his younger self, hoping that her care of Shirou will change the future and grant his wish to save Shirou from his ideals. In the end, Rin finally sees Archer with a genuine smile, the same one as Shirou's.<br>

<p>It is noted that, in this route, Shirou and Rin develop feelings for each other as they grow closer as friends. This scenario also highlights Rin's tsundere qualities. Also Rin is the Winner of the 5th Grail War.</p>
