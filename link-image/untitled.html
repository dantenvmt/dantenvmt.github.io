    <i><b>          IN SHORT, 2 Students switched their body to each others&#46;</b></i></p>
    <p><b>My comment&#58;</b> Taki&#44; you're so <mark>stupid&#44;</mark> man!!!! How does Mitsuha suppose to know your name when you only wrote &quot;I love you&quot;&#46; Well&#44; at least the good thing about this anime is that the directors don't make this movie with bad ending like <strong>5 cm/s</strong>&#46; Or else I will find them and burn them &#128514;&#128514;&#128514;&#128514;&#128514;&#128514;&#128514;</p>
