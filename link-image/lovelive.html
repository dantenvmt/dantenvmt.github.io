	<p><strong>Love Live</strong>, one of the biggest waifu cave lol. My bias is <strong>Kotori Minami</strong> because of her "moe"ness
	<h2>Let's come to introduction</h2>
	<p><strong>Love Live!</strong> (Japanese: ラブライブ! Hepburn: Rabu Raibu!) <b>School Idol Project</b> is a Japanese multimedia project co-developed by ASCII Media Works' Dengeki G's Magazine, music label Lantis, and animation studio Sunrise. The project revolves around a group of fictional schoolgirls who become idols in order to save their school from shutting down. It launched in the August 2010 issue of Dengeki G's Magazine, and went on to produce music CDs, anime music videos, two manga adaptations, and video games. A 13-episode anime television series produced by Sunrise and directed by Takahiko Kyōgoku aired in Japan between January and March 2013, with a second season airing between April and June 2014. Both anime series and film are licensed in North America, the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand by NIS America, MVM Entertainment and Madman Entertainment, respectively. An animated film titled Love Live! The School Idol Movie was distributed by Shochiku and released in June 2015. A follow-up project focusing on a new set of idols, titled <strong>Love Live! Sunshine!!</strong>, launched in 2015.
	<h3>Plot Time:</h3>
	<p>Honoka Kōsaka is a girl who belongs to <b>Otonokizaka Academy</b>. When the school is planned to be closed down due to a lack of applicants, Honoka becomes determined to save it. <strong>Honoka</strong> goes to UTX, where her little sister planned to go for high school, and sees a crowd watching a music video of <strong>A-Rise</strong>, UTX's school idol group. Learning that school idols are popular, Honoka and her friends follow A-Rise's footsteps to start a school idol group called μ's (ミューズ Myūzu, pronounced "muse") to attract new students. Once they successfully prevent Otonokizaka Academy from closing, the girls from μ's aim for higher grounds and participate in Love Live, the ultimate school idol competition featuring the best groups in the country. Despite winning the competition, the girls from μ's disband soon after for their own personal reasons.</p>
	<p><b>Comments:</b> The plot is kinda short because of the content of the anime is basically short(not because of my laziness). 90% of this anime is about their songs and competition. Here's in their best song (in my opinion)<br>
